# Launcher packaging

The launcher packages Jouzu as a native Windows application: a Tauri launcher with its own workspace
screen, a console entry point, the Jouzu application payload, and the runtime that payload needs.
`apps/launcher/` holds the application; everything in this directory builds, verifies, signs and
publishes it.

## Packages

| Artifact | Contents | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jouzu-win-x64-v<jouzu version>-setup.exe` | launcher, console, application payload, Node/pnpm/PortableGit runtime | download, first install, repair |
| `jouzu-win-x64-v<jouzu version>-update.exe` | launcher and launcher-owned support files only | in-app launcher update; the update feed serves only this artifact |

Both are named for the Jouzu release they install and are attached to that release beside the npm
package, so the installer sits on the page a reader opens for the release. Both come from one source
tree in one release, and `build.json` records both versions, the commit, the workflow run and both
hashes. An update package that reaches a tenth of the full package is refused: that means the
application payload was bundled into it, and an update exists precisely so that installing it does
not rewrite the payload.

The launcher carries the version of the Jouzu release it ships in. `apps/launcher/package.json`,
its lockfile, `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` hold that version, the release metadata check refuses a
release where they differ from the npm version, and the bundle step refuses to build a launcher of
another version. The installer's file properties, the Add/Remove entry, logs, crash records and bug
reports therefore name the release the installer came from. Jouzu updates independently of the
launcher, so an installation can report launcher 0.2.0 beside Jouzu 0.2.1.

## Build inputs

The launcher binaries come from the Tauri CLI (`tauri build --no-bundle`), which is what embeds the
frontend into them; a binary from a plain `cargo build` would load the development URL instead, so the
packaging step runs the launcher's own production build check and refuses to bundle one.

Pinned and hash-verified: Node 24.22.1 from nodejs.org (SHA-256 checked against `SHASUMS256.txt`),
PortableGit 2.55.0.5 from git-for-windows (pinned SHA-256), and pnpm 10.21.0. `NOTICES.md` lists the
bundled components and their licences.

## Components

The full package carries the launcher, the console, the Jouzu payload, and the runtime components those
need: Node, pnpm, PortableGit and Windows Terminal. The launcher-only package carries launcher-owned
files only, so an update never rewrites a component. A component that is missing or unusable is
installed from the launcher: the shipped archive when the package carries one, otherwise the pinned
release, verified by digest (and by publisher for PortableGit) before it is extracted.

Windows Terminal hosts the console window, because the standard console host redraws a high-repaint
interface incorrectly, on Windows 10 and Windows 11 alike. The launcher installs the copy it ships before Jouzu starts on a
machine that lacks it, and that copy hosts the console; a Windows Terminal the machine already has is
used only when Jouzu's copy is absent. A folder whose path
contains a semicolon keeps the standard console host, because Windows Terminal treats a semicolon as a
command separator.

## Application staging

`stage-application.mjs` copies a **prepared npm installation prefix** into a separate application directory. It does not install dependencies, execute package scripts, download runtimes, or create an installer.

```sh
node packaging/launcher/stage-application.mjs <prepared-prefix> <new-output-directory> <os-arch> <full-source-commit>
```

The prepared prefix must contain `node_modules/jouzu/dist/cli.js`, the Jouzu package metadata, and a root `package-lock.json`. Only `node_modules`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` are accepted at its root. The output parent must exist, and the output directory must not exist or be inside the input. Linked entries are rejected. Keep build inputs stable while staging.

Supported target labels are `windows`, `macos`, or `linux`, paired with `x64` or `arm64`, for example `windows-x64`. The label records the caller's target; it does **not** verify native binary compatibility.

Output:

```text
output/
  app/                 # copied prepared installation
  inventory.json       # provenance and unpacked file report
```

The report includes file hashes, unpacked sizes, duplicate-content groups and the largest package trees. File paths in the inventory are relative to `app/`; `entrypoint` is relative to the output directory. Nested dependency bytes are attributed to the closest package tree. Duplicate reports are informational: files are not automatically deduplicated. The application source tree is not modified.

The report is not signed release metadata or a compatibility certificate. When the package supplies `gitHead`, staging rejects a different caller-supplied source commit. Verify startup and native dependencies on the target platform before distributing an application archive. Compression, archive signatures, supporting-tool provisioning and launcher activation are separate operations. The source commit is supplied by the caller, not inferred or authenticated by this tool.

Run focused tests through the repository runner:

```sh
npm run test:node -- packaging/launcher/stage-application.test.mjs
```

## Offline starter preparation

`prepare-starter.mjs` runs at build time, not first launch. It copies the supplied Node distribution and private pnpm package, installs a recipe from a prepopulated store with network fallback disabled, and runs Jouzu's version check before making output available:

```sh
node packaging/launcher/prepare-starter.mjs <recipe> <node-runtime> <pnpm-package> <seeded-store> <new-output>
```

The recipe contains `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and optional `patches/`. Pin `packageManager` to `pnpm@10.21.0`. The supplied pnpm package must match. Build on the target OS/architecture using qualified, authenticated inputs. The script does not download or authenticate those inputs itself.

The resulting directory contains `node/`, `pnpm/`, and installed `app/`. Installation uses a frozen lock, production dependencies, disabled lifecycle scripts, a hoisted layout and copied package content. The source store is not copied: shipping a second copy of package content is not required for startup. Packages requiring build scripts must be explicitly prepared and qualified separately; this command does not silently enable scripts.

## Updates

The launcher and the Jouzu application update separately, from their own signed feeds and with their
own key pairs:

- The launcher updates itself through the Tauri updater, from the `launcher-update` feed in the release
  repository, verified with `LAUNCHER_PUBLIC_KEY`. Its version is the Jouzu release version, so
  every release offers a launcher update.
- The Jouzu application updates from the signed recipe described below, verified with
  `JOUZU_RECIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`. Its version is the npm version.

`update-configuration.mjs` writes both feed addresses and both public keys into the build, so an
installation only follows the address it was built with and only accepts a release signed by a key it
already trusts.

## Jouzu updates

A Jouzu update is described by a signed recipe: the npm tarballs, a frozen lock, a manifest and a
signature verified with `JOUZU_RECIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`. The manifest carries the changelog section for the
version being installed as `notes`/`notesSource`, read at the exact commit the registry reports, so the
interface shows text that belongs to the published bytes and a recipe without notes is refused. The
recipe is downloaded from `JOUZU_RECIPE_BASE_URL`, authenticated, staged into
`<managed root>/updates/versions/<slot>` using the installed Node and pnpm, health-checked, and
activated by writing `active.json`; a failed check restores the previous selection. Superseded slots
are pruned after activation, and user data stays in `<managed root>/data`.

The recipe workflow prepares the runtime once per npm version and uploads it for reuse, and a launcher
build restores that qualified runtime instead of preparing the npm package a second time.

## Release signing

Windows Authenticode signatures use Azure Artifact Signing. The tools are obtained the way Microsoft
documents (`nuget.exe install Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools` for signtool and
`Microsoft.ArtifactSigning.Client` for the signing dlib), and `sign-windows.ps1` runs the documented
command (`/fd SHA256`, RFC3161 timestamp, `/dlib`, `/dmdf`) through the bundler's
`bundle.windows.signCommand`. The bundler calls it for the application binaries, for every bundled
`.exe`/`.dll` that does not already carry a vendor signature, and for the NSIS-generated uninstaller
through the define the bundler supplies. The command reads its configuration from the environment
(`JOUZU_SIGN_SIGNTOOL`, `JOUZU_SIGN_DLIB`, `JOUZU_SIGN_METADATA`, `JOUZU_SIGN_SKIP_ROOTS`,
`JOUZU_SIGN_LOG`) and logs every result, which the release prints when a bundle fails.

The application payload and the runtime are never signed: upstream pins their size and SHA-256 and the
payload re-checks both when it starts a native helper, so signing them would disable that check.
`JOUZU_SIGN_SKIP_ROOTS` carries those directories.

Configuration is checked before a build compiles anything (`signing-preflight.mjs`):

| Kind | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | `LAUNCHER_PUBLIC_KEY` | Tauri public verification key embedded in the client |
| Secret | `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Corresponding Tauri signing key |
| Variable | `JOUZU_RECIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Recipe verification key |
| Secret | `JOUZU_RECIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Corresponding recipe signing key |
| Variable | `JOUZU_RECIPE_BASE_URL` | HTTPS recipe directory or release asset base, ending in `/` |
| Variables | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | OIDC signing identity |
| Variables | `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_PROFILE` | Artifact Signing destination |
| Variable | `EXPECTED_SIGNER` | Exact expected Authenticode certificate subject |

The updater signature over the published installer is verified against `LAUNCHER_PUBLIC_KEY` before
publication, so an installer that no installed launcher could verify is never offered.

A release attaches its Windows artifacts to the version release beside the npm package, and those
assets stay replaceable: re-running the installer workflow replaces them, because they are not the
registry-verified package. The `launcher-update` feed names the stored update artifact, carries the
release's section of `CHANGELOG.md` as `notes` and the updater signature. A scheduled check re-verifies that
the published npm version still has a matching signed recipe and opens an issue when it does not, and
the npm publication workflow calls the recipe and installer workflows with `publish: true`, so a
published version cannot exist without its signed Windows update artifact.

## Validation

```sh
npm run test:node -- packaging/launcher/*.test.mjs
```

`Launcher Windows checks` builds the frontend and the Windows binaries, runs these packaging tests and
the Rust tests, and exercises the interface with mocked IPC. It does not sign, publish, or install an
update, and a green check is not installed-upgrade acceptance: verify that a launcher replacement
retains the selected Jouzu version and that a Jouzu update retains user configuration, and test
uninstall separately from a launcher upgrade.
